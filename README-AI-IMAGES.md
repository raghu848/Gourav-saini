# AI-Generated Orthopedic Images Implementation Guide

This guide explains how to implement the actual AI-generated images for the homepage slideshow.

## Current Implementation

The slideshow component is already integrated into the homepage and will automatically display any images placed in the `public/images` directory with the following filenames:

1. `orthopedic-consultation.jpg`
2. `robotic-surgery.jpg`
3. `joint-replacement.jpg`
4. `patient-recovery.jpg`
5. `medical-technology.jpg`

## Generating AI Images

### Option 1: Using DALL-E
1. Visit [OpenAI DALL-E](https://www.openai.com/dall-e)
2. Use the prompts provided in `scripts/generate-placeholder-images.js`
3. Generate images at 1200x600px resolution
4. Download and rename according to the filenames above

### Option 2: Using Midjourney
1. Access Midjourney through Discord
2. Use prompts like:
   ```
   /imagine prompt: A professional orthopedic doctor consulting with a patient in a modern medical office, doctor in white coat with digital tablet, clean hospital environment, realistic style, high detail --ar 2:1
   ```
3. Generate and download images
4. Resize to 1200x600px and save with correct filenames

### Option 3: Using Stable Diffusion
1. Use a local or online Stable Diffusion implementation
2. Use prompts from the script with added style guidance:
   ```
   "professional medical photography, orthopedic surgery, modern hospital, realistic, high detail, 8k, --ar 2:1 --v 5"
   ```

## Image Requirements

- **Format**: JPEG
- **Resolution**: 1200x600px minimum
- **Quality**: High-resolution, realistic, professional
- **Style**: Medical-professional, clean, modern
- **Theme**: Blue and green color scheme to match website
- **Content**: Must be appropriate for medical/healthcare context

## Implementation Steps

1. Generate all 5 images using your preferred AI tool
2. Optimize images for web (compress to under 200KB each)
3. Place images in `public/images/` directory
4. Ensure filenames match exactly:
   - `orthopedic-consultation.jpg`
   - `robotic-surgery.jpg`
   - `joint-replacement.jpg`
   - `patient-recovery.jpg`
   - `medical-technology.jpg`
5. Test the homepage to verify images display correctly

## Testing

After implementing the images:
1. Visit the homepage
2. Verify the slideshow cycles through all 5 images
3. Check that overlay text is clearly visible
4. Confirm responsive behavior on mobile devices
5. Test navigation dots functionality

## Troubleshooting

If images don't appear:
- Verify filenames match exactly (case-sensitive)
- Check image dimensions and format
- Ensure images are in the correct directory
- Clear browser cache and refresh

The slideshow will automatically detect and display the images with smooth fade transitions, rounded corners, and soft shadows as designed.
